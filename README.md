# Duncan’s œuvre with Theatre in the Quarter and related groups

I've been volunteering with Theatre in the Quarter for several years now, in particular for the three children’s drama-groups they run in my hometown of Chester (Jigsaw, Quartz, and Rewind). I design posters and programmes, write lyrics, take photos, and generally help to supervise and direct the kids.

Here I've documented what I've done for them. I also include posters I’ve done for the women’s choir A Handbag of Harmonies and photography for the mini-festival Chester International Music Week.

It’s a static React page. The data, in Json format, have been output by an Excel spreadsheet I have privately. (I refresh the data when I notice a typo or there’s a new play for me to add.) Productions can be filtered by clicking on values such as the name of the troupe or the year of performance; this uses query strings with React Router.
